**About Have_A_Word:**

Have_A_Word is a chat room service, similar to the site at this link: https://tlk.io/ It was built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js) stack. It is a proof-of-concept deal, and not a production project.

I undertook this project to increase my understanding of Web Sockets and Redux, and to demonstrate that I am capable of making a somewhat sophisticated real-time communication app.

Users can make chatrooms at custom URLs, with optional password protection, and with custom expiration dates.
