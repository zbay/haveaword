**About Have-A-Word:**

Have-A-Word is a chat room service, similar to the site at this link: https://tlk.io/ It was built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js) stack. It is a proof-of-concept deal, and not a production project.

I undertook this project to get a handle on Socket.io (which turns out to be super-easy), and to demonstrate that I am capable of making a practical real-time communication app.

Users can make chatrooms at custom URLs, with optional password protection, and with custom expiration dates. You can use Markdown to style your messages.
