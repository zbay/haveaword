Statement of intent:

Opine is my first 100% independent project (not done as an assignment for a course or tutorial). This will be a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js) stack project that will hopefully utilize advanced React-tools tools such as React Router and Redux, in addition to Web Sockets for real-time updates.

What will this project do, once completed? Users will be able to do one of two things: 

1. Solicit opinions. Do you have a radio show, a blog, a YouTube video, or even just a personal question that you'd like to receive some comment on? Post your opinion request on Opine for the world to see.
2. Browse the opinion-seeking posts on the site and answer their questions if you are so inclined.

Internet commenters get a bad rap, but Opine provides an opportunity for them to redeem themselves. It's a friendly ear for opinionated loudmouths!
