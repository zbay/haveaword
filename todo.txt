DRY: Merge Posting and Question into one

Clearly mark "My Favorites", and send error if more than 100 active are in the array. Explain the limitation
Show number of comments
Comment chains (reply directly to comments)
Sanitize all inputs
If category is the same as the current category for a new post, or it is in "All", append comment automatically to the list. Use Redux?

Redirect to new post page on post create
