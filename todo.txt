1. Better error handling at the server
2. Heroku
3. Should be able to add to favorite from the individual question
4. Periodic deletion of expired questions
5. Redux
6. Sort by expiring and by most commented
7. React Router full server-side
8. Test your sanitization
9. More responsive with alternative stylesheets http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18470350/css-media-queries-not-working-anywhere
10. Commenting code
11. Send user directly to the standalone question page, after posting new question
12. Mongo queries: exclude fields you won't retrieve
13. 
14. Local storage: automatically add posts that you make to local storage favorites
15. Refactor ActionBar as a conventional nav bar
16. On page change, reset action bar's category
17. No page arrow if the number of posts is less than perPage (add perPage in)
18.
19. Use localStorage to maintain state (like loggedIn!) on reload for redux

DRY: Merge Posting and Question into one

Clearly mark "My Favorites", and send error if more than 100 active are in the array. Explain the limitation
Add to purge old: remove the ID from User's favorites
Enable editing and deletion of user's comments
Check if favorite, and pass it down
Show number of comments
Make standalone question editable, by refactoring to use Posting with more data
Convert inputs to textfields where desirable
DELETE AND EDIT COMMENTS


Use LocalStorage to preserve login state despite reload. Test on one component before useing the same approach everywhere
