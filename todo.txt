1. Better error handling at the server
2. Write About content.
3. Loading animation instead of error as default
4. Periodic deletion of expired questions
5. Clearly mark "My Favorites"
6. Sort by expiring and by most commented
7. React Router server-side?
8. Test your sanitization
9. Send user to the category of the new post, after the new post
10. Check if IP address is banned before posting
11. Account for the possibility that a post has been deleted from local storage
12. Mongo queries: exclude fields you won't retrieve

DRY: error/success spans in a div. Merge Posting and Question into one
